        The project is part of the data sciences lesson. We use programming areas in the web environment and data science.
        In this project, we use Python, Flask, and Pandas in the Visual Studio. As part of the project, I located databases
        on the network and intend to build a website around them that allows access to the databases, data analysis and easy
        presentation to users.The site allows the user to explore the data in the selected field and try to get insights and
        conclusions of value.
