        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
            The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness
            that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.

        <h2>Why I chose this topic?</h2>
        <p>
            In my idea, it's interesting to know what countries or regions rank
            the highest in overall happiness or did any country experience a significant
            increase or decrease in happiness between the years 2016, 2018 and 2019?

        <h2>My sources</h2>
        <p>
            I took the information from a website named Kaggle.
            Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.
            It's eazy to find information there and it's free.
